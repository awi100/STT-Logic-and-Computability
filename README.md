HTML/Javascript App for making short truth tables

This idea was created by Bram van Heuveln for his various logic classes.

The goal of this project is to have a working app that can save/load data, grade students' work, and give hints on how to make a short truth table.

You may create as many statements as you like using the + button and delete them with the - button.

Once you are satisfied with your result and you believe all your statements are syntactically correct,
you may press the submit button and they will be generated into a truth table form.  For any operators or atomic statements, you may place a "T" or a "F" to denote true and false for each of them.

NEW FEATURES:

Dropdown menu that allows selection of possible reasons for the next step in the table, and records them

Contradiction allows user to show that the value of an element in the tree contradicts another possible value

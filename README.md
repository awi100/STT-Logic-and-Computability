## About
HTML/Javascript App for making short truth tables

This idea was created by Bram van Heuveln for his various logic classes.

The goal of this project is to have a working app that can save/load data, grade students' work, and give hints on how to make a short truth table.

You may create as many statements as you like using the "Add Expression" button and delete them with the x button.

Once you have entered in all of your premises and your conclusion, you can click on the 'table' option and view your inputs as a short truth table. Here the premises will default to true and the conclusion will default to false and you may click on different literals and operators and assign them values. When assigning values you will be asked to give a rule as to why you can assign the value that you did and it will be checked as to whether that is a valid thing to do or not.

FEATURES:

Import/Export data

Options of validity, consistency, and tautology

Able to assign T or F to literals/operators and have it be checked if that is a valid thing to do
